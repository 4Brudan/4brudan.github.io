          <p class="textf">This contest is focused on the design and manufacturing of a race car similar to that of one
            that competes in Formula 1 but of smaller proportions (Length: between 17-21 cm; Width: maximum 8,5 cm;
            Height: Maximum 6,5 cm). One crucial element of the project is coming up with a well thought out financial
            plan that includes various sponsorships. We are writing to you today with the intent of obtaining financial
            assistance from your company in order to acquire all the equipment needed to design, assemble and test our
            vehicle.</p>

              there the two of them collaborated with their teammates in order to improve the product using their
              suggestions to make changes to the car so that everyone was confident in it. On top of that, they worked
              with the marketing department in order to deliver a general concept that fitted the sponsors’ expectations
              and also the manufacturing department so that the product can be made efficiently using the CNC machine.
              Furthermore, they tested the 3D model of the car in order to assess its aerodynamic properties so that
              they could determine what elements needed to be improved so that the car could achieve the team’s
              goals.<br>

              of winning. Throughout all of this they managed the team’s social media accounts on various platforms
